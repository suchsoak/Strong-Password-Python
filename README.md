# Strong Password With Python
# The strong random password with python.

 When running the script, you will have the option to choose the letter count and even whether it will be a weak or strong password.
 
So you don't forget your password, I put it in a txt file "password.txt".

> This script will be updated over time, so I'll do it better.
