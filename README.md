# Strong Password With Python
# The strong random password with python.

 When running the script, you will have the option to choose the letter count and even whether it will be a weak or strong password.
 
 In order for you not to forget your password, you may need to put it in a txt file. In the future I will make an option to save the password in a txt file.

> This script will be updated over time, so I'll do it better.
